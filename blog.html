                <p>The University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore (UET Lahore) is a public university located in
                    Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan specializing in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
                    subjects.
                    It is the oldest and one of the most selective engineering institutions in Pakistan.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Founded in 1 January 1921 in Mughalpura, a suburban area of Lahore, as Mughalpura Technical College,
                    it later became the 'MacLagan Engineering College', a name given to it in 1923 after Sir Edward
                    Douglas MacLagan, the then Governor of Punjab, who laid the foundation stone of the main building,
                    now called the Main Block.
                    In 1929, it was affiliated with the University of Punjab for the award of Bachelor's Degrees in
                    Electrical and Mechanical Engineering. In 1939, the name was again changed to Punjab College of
                    Engineering and Technology, and a Civil Engineering degree was also started in the college.
                    At the time of partition, part of the college relocated to India, called East Punjab College of
                    Engineering. In 1954, a bachelor's degree program in mining engineering was started. In 1962, it was
                    granted charter and was named the West Pakistan University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore.
                    During the 1960s, bachelor's degree programs were started in chemical engineering, petroleum and gas
                    engineering, metallurgical engineering, architecture and city and regional planning.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In 1972, it was officially renamed the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore. By the
                    1970s, it had established a score of master's degree programs in engineering, architecture, city and
                    regional planning and allied disciplines.
                    Several Ph.D. degree programs were also started. A second campus of the university was established
                    in 1975 in Sahiwal which was relocated to Taxila in 1978 and became an independent university in
                    1993 called the University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila.
                    Today, it is widely considered one of the best and most prestigious engineering universities in
                    Pakistan where more than 50,000 students apply for admission every year.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The university, as of 2016, had a faculty of 881 people of which 257 had doctorates. It has a total
                    of 9,385 undergraduate and 1,708 postgraduate students studying.
                    It has a strong collaboration with the University of South Carolina, University of Manchester and
                    the Queen Mary University of London and has conducted research funded by Huawei, Cavium Networks,
                    Microsoft and MontaVista.
                    It is one of the highest ranked universities in Pakistan with domestic rankings placing it as the
                    third best engineering school in Pakistan while QS World University Ranking put it as 279th in world
                    in the category of Engineeing & Technology in the year 2023.
                    It is also ranked 51-100 in the category of Petroleum Engineering, 251-300 in Electrical &
                    Electronics Engineering, 251-300 in Mechanical Engineering, 301-350 in Chemical Engineering and
                    401-450 in Computer Science & Information Systems in the world by the same publication in 2023.
                    Meanwhile, in Asia the university ranking is currently ranked at No. 165th. As of 2023, Computer
